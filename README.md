# Data Scientist - Models Lab @ Cerved Group spa
Extensive experience in the development, deployment, and backtesting of probabilistic models.
Main projects include rare-event modeling for anomaly detection and credit risk modeling.
Acquisition of substantial knowledge in Graph Theory and utilisation of the Bayesian framework
to incorporate domain knowledge from experts into models.
Synthetic data generation using various approaches, such as Variational AutoEncoders and
Agent-Based Modeling, to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the predictive models.

# Cerved Group spa
